The largest portion of my computer science experience revolves around front end web development, and using the languages C++, Typescript, Javascript, and Python. I hope that my experience with front end design can help us create a functional and aestetically pleasing puzzle game.

My individual goals for this project are to gain familiarity with Unity, which is a platform I haven't worked on before. As a group, I hope that we can make an entertaining puzzle game with smooth mechanics, and a variety of challenging levels or hurdles to keep the user interested.

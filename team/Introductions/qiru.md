## Qiru

Hi, I'm Qiru, a 4th year CS major student. I'm familiar with Unity and C#. 

For this project, I want to build a Unity 2D platformer puzzle game involves solving puzzle by connecting items in different locations. Player should make use of items near them to move items in a distance, to trigger a door, move away obstacles or block enemies.

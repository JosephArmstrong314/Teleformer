# Date of Retrospective: 01/27/23

* Led by: Qiru Hu
* Present: Matt Reddick, Qiru Hu, Joseph Armstrong, Sheldin Lau, Hao Wu, Andrew Kwon, Connor Gorsuch
* Absent: 

## Action item

* a goal: Have better github workflow and collaboration
* a change: Submitting more pull requests and review teammates' pull requests. Having peer coding. Have better communication (e.g. ask for help immediately in slack).
* a measurement: Measure the number of pull requests. Check if all these pull requests are reviewed by a reviewer other than the pr owner.


## Optional
Here's the team's refelection about things to start/stop/continue:
### Start
* Peer coding sessions to gain multiple insights when dealing with aspects that rely more on design (levels, ui, etc.) rather than simple coding implementations.
* Making new branches for each specific feature/issue we are working on.
* Delete old named branches if no longer using (we will end up having a large amount of branches).
* Doing pull requests.
* Submit pull request often. Make sure pull request is small. Ask for a teammate to review pr before merging.
* Pairing people into tasks based on skill level and experience. Someone less experienced should be paired with someone more experienced. We have 7 people, so either an experienced team member would work on an issue by themselves, or one issue would have 1 experienced person and 2 less experienced people.
* Daily updates in the channel. I like the idea of not having to meet in-person/zoom every day, but instead just typing here in the Slack. This would help us with Integrated Development as well as keeping everyone accountable. I would expect not every day would have major progress, but even just reading what everyone else in the team is doing would just be good team communication.
* Discuss a clear protocol for dealing with the GitHub workflow. I was thinking that we could have our own personal branches and a branch for each issue. We could use our personal branches as a proxy for the main branch to rebase the code in the issue branch we are working on. I think this will ease some worry about messing with the main branch. I also want to look into branch protection for the main branch anyways. Defensive coding would say that anyone could easily accidentally type "push origin main" when they didn't mean to, and branch protection could help with this. I'll ask the teaching team if this is allowed.
* Set up some kind of learning infrastructure where team members sort of "teach" the rest of the team how to do their issue, since part of the goal of this class/project is for everyone to learn the basics of everything everyone else did.
* Document team subset meetings. What I mean is that if 2 or 3 of us need to meet together to work on an issue, which clearly doesn't directly involve the rest of the team, then we should document those meetings too in the /team directory on GitHub.
* Holding short calls between pairs of people when they need to integrate their code together both beforehand to create a plan and after to assist in integration.
* Instead of working individually, start working in pairs
* Having some sort of executable
* Updating github with latest changes
* Use retro software to present retros and vote on the most relavant items. 
 E.g. https://www.retrospected.com/game/O71O0P-SI

### Stop
* Committing directly into main branch (besides markdown files for meeting notes/team markdowns).
* Vague responses during scrum? kind of to be expected from the start of our project but we should take advantage of this time more appropriately as we move forward.
* Putting the requirement for a story after it is done.
* Merge pr without other teammate’s review.
* Merging a pull request to main without it being looked over, particularly for code that interacts with work other people have done.
* Discuss a bit less during the time we are in groups and try connecting each part we are working on
* Having too much broad/vague discussion

### Continue
* Staying ahead of the curve and being proactive about getting labs/work done
* Utilizing the slack to send tutorials for various unity aspects
* Just being a great overall team in general!
* Sharing resources on how to use unity and tutorials that will helps us make the game.
* Ask for help whenever there’s a blocker. Don't wait for team meeting to ask for help.
* Asking questions. I would like to commend @Hao Wu for asking questions almost every meeting we have. This is what our team needs to keep doing so that we all learn at the same time. And to add to this, I think we all understand that GitHub can be a headache. And perhaps some of us are more experienced with GitHub than others, but this is ok. I think if we continue to ask questions, then we will all figure it out.
* Giving heads up in the Slack when we won't be able to attend class or meetings. This is something that I've had negative experiences with in the past, so I'm very appreciative of this team for doing an excellent job with this. Keep it up!
* Documenting where we get our assets and sharing the tutorials we find with each other.
* Asking for help
* Communication using slack


## Retro Assessment
I used the Start/Stop/Continue retro template. Each team member wrote down the things they think should start/stop/continue and send to slack channel and then explained why they think so.

This reto went pretty well. All team members shared about their reflection for the team to improve upon. These opinions are very helpful in improving the efficiency of teamwork. 

My advice to the next person leading a retro is to come up with a main topic at the start of the retro meeting. This may help the teammates to better reflect.

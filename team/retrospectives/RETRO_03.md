* Present: Matt Reddick, Qiru Hu, Joseph Armstrong, Sheldin Lau, Hao Wu, Andrew Kwon, Connor Gorsuch
* Absent: 

## Action item

* a goal: Have a better idea of what we want on our final product and how we can reach it.
* a change: Making more pull requests to split up large pull requests and be more clear of what each each team member is responsible for.
* a measurement: Measure the amount of issues we would need to finish before out final product.


## Optional
Here's the team's refelection about things to start/stop/continue:
### Start
* continue doing PR, working towards final product, communication on slack
* Keep working toward the final product.
* Finish all 9 levels (or whatever number it is) asap so that we can try and modify each 'difficulty" of levels to have matching aesthetic (i.e. easy - grass, medium - snow, hard - fire) and change the level selection menu as such 
* Continue asking how the things integrate together to make the game better
* We should continue to plan as a team about the most efficient way to meat our goals for the product.
* It's great to add more levels and have more people contribute to the level ideas.
* Making PRs
 E.g. https://www.retrospected.com/game/O71O0P-SI

### Stop
* Making alot of changes in just one pull request
* We should be more clear on the exact goal and responsibilities for each person's work in the next two weeks so that we can be coordinated in finishing the necessary features of the product.
* Possible work on less levels and more ui/ux stuff
* Please make sure everyone having issues move to done in kanban board
* Not making PRs

### Continue
* go through issues in backlog and remove unneeded ones/assign important outstanding ones
* Finish up required documents
* Check lab completion status. Notify teammates if there's something not done yet.
* Collaborate on issues so we can finish large issues more efficiently
* We should start identifying the largest gameplay issues at the moment and solve them in time for the final product.
* Start coming up a final list of features or goals we want to achieve for the final product to make it clear.
* Determining what features we need to prioritize the most before code freeze, and what aspects will be most beneficial to differentiating this product from the MVP
* Making more PRs


## Retro Assessment
I used the Start/Stop/Continue retro template. Each team member wrote down the things they think should start/stop/continue and we went on a website called Retrospective and wrote down all the things that we want to start/stop/continue and discussed about the things we wrote.

The retro went pretty smooth. Every team member was able to discuss why they wrote it and were able to elaborate more on it. We were able to figure out what we need to do right before the code freeze.

My advice to the next person leading is to come up with questions to keep the conversation going.

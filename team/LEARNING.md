# LEARNING.md

## Description:
Over the course of our project, we will be using the following technologies: Git, GitHub, Unity, C#.
Hopefully, by the end of this project, everyone will have learned many new skills as well as either learning or improving with the technologies.
Below is a table of our teams familiarity with each technology on a scale of 1 to 5 at the *beginning* of the project.

## What a 5 means:
- A 5 for Git/GitHub means you can create a repo, push to a repo, handle multiple branches, make pull requests, resolve merge conflicts, use a .gitignore file, find your way around the Kanban board, and overall understand how to utilize Git/GitHub in a team setting.
- A 5 for Unity means you could probably do this whole project by yourself if everyone just turned into clones of yourself.
- A 5 for C# means you could redo CS130A using only C#.

## Table:
| Name    | Git/GitHub | Unity | C#  |
| ------- | ---------- | ----- | --- |
| Joseph  | 5 | 1 | 1 |
| Connor  | | | |
| Matt    | | | |
| Qiru    | | | |
| Hao     | | | |
| Sheldin | | | |
| Andrew  | | | |

This is part of the project that I imported from my UCSB GitHub account. The important development files are in the Assets/Scripts folder. The game can be played on itch.io: [Teleformer](https://qiruhu.itch.io/teleformer).

## Project Description:
For my CS148 project course, I worked with a team of 7 CS students to develop a 2D puzzle platformer in Unity. This game requries players to solve puzzles using telekinetic powers to link objects to other objects or the player. This project won the Audience Choice Award, and my contributions to the team included Team Management, Git/GitHub Expert, Agile/Scrum Master, UI Development, and Game Designer. Having the most experience on the team, it was my priviledge to teach the rest of my teammates proper Git/GitHub protocols to maximize code organization, minimize merge conflicts, maintain an organized Kanban board, and facilitate a professional CI/CD pipeline. I also made sure the project followed industry standards regarding the object-oriented design of code modules and file structure. I had a phenomenal experience with my team Agile operations, including daily Standups, Scrum meetings, Sprint Planning, and Retrospectives. I wish to work with more teams like that in my career. Our game is available on itch.io: [Teleformer](https://qiruhu.itch.io/teleformer).

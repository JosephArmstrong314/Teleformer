## Connor

My main proficiencies are in C and C++ with an emphasis on robotics. I hope that my experience programming for physical systems can help in developing a physics based puzzle game.

My goals for this project are broadly to make an enjoyable puzzle game with novel mechanics, and specifically to make manipulating 2D physics objects in complex ways an intuitive experience with mechanical depth.

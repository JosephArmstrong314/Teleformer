# User Feedback Topic Goals

## Level Progression (The order in which puzzles and mechanics are presented.)

The goal of our full-game-tutorial design strategy is for each level to build on the ideas of the previous with the user never reaching a challenge that they feel is outside of what they are capable of solving - they should never think they are completely blocked. The feedback we want from playtesting (other than the lower level individual puzzle design specifics) is what the players find to be the best order for levels to be presented. We are planning on gathering this feedback by arranging the puzzles in an order we hope will work then testing the full level order with multiple new testers and asking when they feel stuck or when they are finding puzzles unduly difficult / not fun. As a part of this testing process our goal is to give no hints, but we will give a hint if a tester is stuck on a puzzle for far too long - making note of that as a place where we need to change the design. This feedback will then be useful of both determining the most fun order of levels and for finding is we need to ass more easy introductory levels to ensure that a player has the tools and understanding they need to solve the harder challenges. 

## Visual Mechanic Presentation

We want the function of each mechanic to be visually obvious to the player so to determine what is the best way to visually represent complex interactions we want to gather A/B testing data from players about their intuitive understanding of visuals. To do this we will prototype multiple designs and then present them in a random order to a tester fist just showing the visual and asking them to explain that they think it means, then letting them interact with the visual and mechanic for a short time and asking what they think it means, and finally after repeating this ask whether they prefer one design A/B or the other based on how easy it is to intuit its meaning and why.

## Full Playthroughs to Find the Fun.


In designing additional levels we want to fucus on challenges which they players report finding interesting and enjoyable to solve. To do this we will watch and ask questions during many playerâ€™s full game playthroughs. Our goal for these tests is to not prime the player with any information or expectation but to get their true reactions to all successes, failures, and sticking points. We will then use this feedback to focus our future development and alter out current work to emphasize the designs that contribute to an interesting experience, both the enjoyable successes and rewarding challenges.

## Is the current key binding convenient for the players? Do players want to choose their own key bindings? The current key bindings are:

W - Look Up

A - Move Left or Look Left

S - Look Down

D - Move Right or Look Right

Space - Jump

/ - Shoot Link

Right Shift - Activate Links

Left Shift - Look in place (A and D will not move character left of right)

Numkeys - Change Links

ESC - Activate Pause Menu

R - Restart Level

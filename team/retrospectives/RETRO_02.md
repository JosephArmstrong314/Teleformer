# Date of Retrospective: 02/17/23

* Led by: Matt Reddick
* Present: Matt Reddick, Qiru Hu, Joseph Armstrong, Sheldin Lau, Hao Wu, Connor Gorsuch
* Absent: Andrew Kwon (Participated in retro via slack)

## Action item

* a goal: Brainstorm more level ideas/designs and consolidate these ideas in one location. (Ideally we have 9 levels at minimum)
* a change: Embrace more peer collaboration whether it be in ideating level design or in actual peer programming. 
* a measurement: Measure the number of level designs added to the game, and measure the gradual difficulty change throughout levels. 

## Optional
Here's the team's refelection about things to start/stop/continue:
### Start
* We should start documenting level concepts and mechanic ideas in an accessible location so that we can have a smoother process of both designing levels and deciding which mechanics belong is which level groups and if they should be in the early or late game 
* We need more level design ideas. Everyone should contribute to it.
* Finding a theme for our game
* Communicating more through Slack, or at least acknowledging that you read a message by reacting with a thumbs up or a check mark or something
* I think we've now figured out the general structure of the kanban board (huge shoutout Joseph), lets stay consistent and keep the kanban board working as it is now
* brainstorming more difficult level ideas, so that we can really challenge the user
* Start to generate more detailed ideas about the final product of the game
* Working together on stories that are large

### Stop
* failing to acknowledge peoples messages or questions in slack, a simple emoji or small response would be sufficient
* Changing the file organization/hierarchy of the project without explaining to the team what the change was and why
* Not collaborating on the levels
* Stop using one time solutions to code problems such as where user data is stored and instead discuss what overall design pattern we want to use so no one is confused about where we are storing or managing different game subsystems.
* Do not only submit the pr. But also link relevant issues and make sure accepting criterias are ready.


### Continue
* We should continue discussing the pros and cons of design decisions for the project based on player testing in meetings so that everyone can be on the same page about the trajectory and we can respond to what players find fun.
* continue to discuss new ideas for how to elevate the game to the next level, considering that the teaching staff thinks our project may be inherently easier to construct than others
* Keep communicating, keep sharing new ideas and technologies
* Communicating during standups and in-class meetings
* being a great team! happy to have a good group of people to work on this with 
* When a pr is made, post in slack ask for review. Whoever saw the pr, help teammates to review pr asap.
* Asking for clarification when we don't understand something


## Retro Assessment
I used the Start/Stop/Continue retro template (with a bonus "highlight of the week" column). Each team member wrote down the things they think should start/stop/continue on the retro website https://www.retrospected.com/game/LdXDCuyoo/summary. 

This retro went pretty well, and we have found that the retro has been very productive for establishing "next steps" for the team. All team members shared about their reflection for the team to improve upon. 

My advice to the next person leading a retro is to try and only focus on the comments that are highly upvoted during the retro. This may help the team not run over time for the retro.

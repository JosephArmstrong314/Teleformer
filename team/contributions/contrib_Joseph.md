#### Explaining the contributions graph:

Somehow, I ended up using two github accounts (my school account jarmstrong845 and my personal account JosephArmstrong314) to make commits to this project. Also, my commits tended to be very large, either restructuring the file hierarchy of the project or make huge changes to the options menu and game management of the game. Overall, my focus on the project was geared towards code efficiency, project organization, and scalability of the current trajectory of the project. Unfortunately, I was unable to spare time to create a few levels of my own (unlike most others on the team). I did actually draw out a few levels on paper.

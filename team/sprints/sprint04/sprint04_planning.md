## Scribed Discussion:
 - This meeting we planned our timeline and actions for completing the product within the 3/17 deadline.
 - We have divided up our current actions among members into additional levels and functionality improvements. 
 - We plan on finishing the additional levels as soon as possible targeting the end of the weekend ending on the 12th so that afterward we can make visual improvements to distinguish the game form the MVP and so that we can playtest and fix issues.
 - We have planned out the coordination of mechanics and player knowledge for the level progression and have finalized our plan for the finished product.
 - We have reflected this planning in an updated Kanban board.
